## Notes
The front end is built using React. JSON data is hosted on the JSON server and Axios is used to fetch data from the API.
I used React because it has many benefits like being able to create resuable components. It performs better and smoother due to virtual DOM. Code can easily be tested by creating unit tests with the help of Jest.


### Date
25-05-2021



### Location of deployed application
### Application hosted on: 
### JSON data: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/gowthami-sukhavasi/WeatherAPI/weather



### Time spent
4 hours 



### Assumptions made
The project's goal is to create an API with JSON data. When a city name is searched through the UI, a call is made to the API to retrieve the city's weather and displayed accordingly.



### Shortcuts/Compromises made
To make this application better in the Real world scenario, I would add the actual weather data in the API. I would make the UI more interesting to see. For ex: Displaying icons and using colours according to the weather.



### Stretch goals attempted
Built a simple UI
Deployed the API on JSON server
I wish I could have tried better to add authentication to make this project better.


### Instructions to run assignment locally
Download the repository and navigate to the project directory.
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.



### What did you not include in your solution that you want us to know about?
I wanted to add and use real weather data but I faced authentication issues with the openWeather API.
